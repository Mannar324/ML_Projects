# Overview:
this project uses machine learning algorithms to classify peoples who has heart disease and not based on various features like, age, gender, family history, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and more .this project involves exploratory data analysis(EDA),data cleaning, and visualized to gain insights into the relationship between features and the target variable,and using  Machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees.
# Data:
The data used in this project is Heart Disease dataset that include information about people's age and their state of health.The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned before used in analysis. 
# Analysis:
this analysis involves several steps,including:
1-Exploratory data analysis(EDA):
this involves visualizing the data and identifying patterns,trends,and realationships between variables.
2-scaling the features: it can help improve the performance of the algorithms and make them more accurate. Feature scaling involves transforming the values of the features in a dataset so that they are on the same scale, which can help to reduce the impact of differences in the magnitude of the features.
3-Classification using Machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees.
4-Evaluation of the classification results:we used various evaluation metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score.
# Results:
the Logistic Regression has the highest score,indicating that it was the most effective algorithm for Heart disease prediction.
